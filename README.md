# RoachBot
These are Original legacy files written in the Arduino language to control a self driven "Roach Bot". Created for fun this Roach Bot was designed to avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor, run from excess light to find shade using a Photo Resistor, Scream and Play a jingle using a speaker, and drive itself using a single electric motor.

This project was created early in my educational career (2017) and was the very first project related to software & hardware. 

A updated version is coming soon!
